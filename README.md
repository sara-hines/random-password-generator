# Random Password Generator | JavaScript & Logic Practice

## Description

This random password generator incorporates JavaScript to dynamically update HTML and CSS, generating a random password based on the user's criteria. The project was an opportunity to think algorithmically, to logically deduce a set of steps towards given acceptance criteria, and to debug along the way. Furthermore, with the ever advancing skills of bad actors attempting to gain access to data and resources, password security is an important value to pursue and build around. 

This project allows for very strong passwords to be generated, depending on the criteria the user selects, while also providing flexibility depending on user preference. The application is very responsive in multiple sensesâ€”it incorporates user input to create a password with the length and types of characters of their choosing; it implements an event listener on a button element to trigger the prompts and password generation; it uses media queries and responsive design practices to adapt to various screen sizes. While building the password generator, I attempted to perspective-take with the user, creating prompts for user input which would be clear and easy to follow, while keeping in mind factors for greater security, such as password length and methods which allow random selection of characters. 

## Installation

No installation is required to use this application.

## Usage and Features

When the user navigates to the web page at [https://sara-hines.github.io/random-password-generator/] (https://sara-hines.github.io/random-password-generator/ 'GitHub Pages Link'), the page has the following appearance, with a heading of "Password Generator," a textarea element with placeholder text, "Your Secure Password," and a "Generate Password" button.

Upon clicking the button, a series of dialog boxes appear, as depicted in the images below. The first dialog box asks the user to enter their desired length of password, from 8 characters minimum to 128 characters maximum. If the user enters a valid number greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 128, additional dialog boxes will appear in succession, asking the user if they would like to include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters, respectively (see the below screenshots).

Once all of the prompts have been answered, a password matching the specified criteria is displayed in the text area. In this demo, a length of 30 characters was specified, with lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters all to be included.

There are several scenarios in which user input must be rejected: if the user provides a length outside of the specified range; if the user provides a value for length which is not a number; and if the user elects not to include any of the types of characters in their password. In these cases, a dialog box will appear describing the error and how to provide acceptable inputâ€”see the below screenshots.

## Logic Involved

For a brief description of the logic involved: the password is generated by creating separate arrays to store all possible characters of each type (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters), adding these arrays to a new array only if the user elects to use the type of character, and randomly selecting one element from the resultant array at a time until the desired password length is reached. Additionally, as this is a random process, it is possible that the user might choose to include a type of character and that the no character of that type is selected from the array of possible choices. To ensure the final password includes at least one character of each type the user selects, an array is created to store a random element of each desired character type, and characters from that array are brought in to replace some of the characters in the draft password. Feel free to peruse the script.js to see what's happening in greater detail!

I worked with a tutor, Alexis Gonzalez, very early on in the project, who helped me translate the math logic of 8 <= length <= 128 into JavaScript logic of (length < 8 || length > 128). Alexis also helped set me on the right track for translating very loose English pseudocode / algorithm into JavaScript objects. I used Ask BCS to help flesh out the contents of a for loop I had started, and Ask BCS was also helpful in figuring out how to ensure at least one of each character selected by the user would appear in the final password. I'm grateful for the assistance and resources available to me through the University of Denver and the infinite cosmos of the web ðŸ˜‰!
